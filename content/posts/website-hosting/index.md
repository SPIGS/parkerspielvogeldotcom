A month ago Vultr, the provider I used to host this website, decided to require its users to agree to their new terms of service in order to continue using their hosting services. These new terms contained a clause that grants Vultr full commercial and legal rights to the content stored on their servers. Here is the full text:

> You hereby grant to Vultr a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your User Content, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and otherwise use and commercialize the User Content in any way that Vultr deems appropriate, without any further consent, notice and/or compensation to you or to any third parties, for purpose of providing the Services to you.

This clause has since been removed from their terms and they stated that this only covered the content posted on their development forums. Whether or not this is true, I decided not to host this website there any more.

## Using the content from this site - no robots allowed

I don't plan on monetizing the content on this site, but I'd still like to retain my rights over it. It is my work, after-all. However, if by some chance some one would like to use something I've written, all I ask is for it to be cited.

One exception is that I do not consent for any content on this site to be used in the training of language models or used in anyway by Artificial Intelligence companies. I'm not really on the whole AI hype-train.
